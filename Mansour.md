## 🍴 Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Nut Filling:
1. Mix the chopped nuts and ground cinnamon in a bowl. Set aside.

### 2. Assemble the Baklava:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.
3. Place one sheet of phyllo in the dish and brush with melted butter. Repeat this step for about 8 sheets.
4. Sprinkle a thin layer of the nut mixture.
5. Add two more sheets of phyllo, buttering each one, followed by another layer of nuts.
6. Repeat layers until all the nut mixture is used, finishing with 8 more layers of phyllo on top, each brushed with butter.
7. Using a sharp knife, cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the dish.

### 3. Bake:
1. Bake for about 50 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and crisp.

### 4. Make the Syrup:
1. While the baklava is baking, combine all syrup ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat.
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
3. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

### 5. Add Syrup:
1. Immediately after removing baklava from the oven, slowly pour the syrup over the hot baklava.
2. Let it soak for several hours (overnight is best).
